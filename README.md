# Marvelous
Marvelous was a solo project completed in one week. I was randomly assigned the Marvel API to use as the main content source and 'parents of young children' as the target audience. My goal was to create a simple application that a parent could show to a child too young to read a comic book or watch many of the Marvel movies, in order to introduce them to the Marvel Universe. It could also be valuable to the parent of a child who is interested in Marvel to familiarize themselves with the content their child is digesting.
