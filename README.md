# Marvelous
Marvelous was a solo project completed in one week in Mod 3 at Turing. My goal was to create a simple, visual application that a parent could use to introduce a young child to the Marvel Universe. It could also be useful for a parent looking to familiarize themselves with the content their son or daughter is digesting.
